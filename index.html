          Social media apps such as Instagram are enabling people to more easily share their content
          to a wider group of people. Advances in technology have led to increased accessibility; as costs decrease,
          the photo quality available to amateurs increases.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white mb-2">
          Amateur photographers are now able to do a lot more, for a lot less money. This is a rapidly
          innovating market, with devices coming on the market that enable a wider range of photography
          techniques to be harnessed more easily and cheaply. One aspect of
          photography that is still dominated by professionals is time-lapse photography. Time-lapse photography can be used in
          conjunction with translational and rotational camera movement to create truly stunning time-lapses.
          For professionals there are belt-driven sliders that
          can translate a camera. However, these are prohibitively expensive for an amateur photographer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white mb-2">
          There is no camera equipment that is reasonably priced and portable for amateurs. <b>Motion Lapse</b> will be able to give this
          fuctionality to amatuers.

      <p class="text-white mb-5">Tools used for this website are predominately Atom and GitHub. Atom has provided a very
        easy to use source code editor and has embedded Git Control. This allows for the seemless updating of the live website
        which is hosted on GitPages. All what is needed is to push the master branch of the repository to GitHub. GitHub
        automatically uses the master branch of the repository to publish the site. Additionally Git allows for verison
        control meaning that if something does go wrong it is easy to go back to a previous commit and carry on working,
        rather than starting from the beginning again. Snippets of code (e.g. the contact form) were taken from various places such
        as w3schools and getbootstrap, this meant that the website could be "hacked" together without having in-depth knowledge of JavaScript,
        HTML or CSS.

        A good website must have a ensure that the user experience is clear, easy, alluring, interesting, enjoyable and informative.
        The purpose of the website should be abunantly clear from the outset, and it shoud be visually attractive. The content is
        also very important. It must be informative but not bland and over-detailed. It should only include the relevant facts required
        by the intended user of the website. The navigation between pages are sections should be intuitive. It shouldn't be confusing
        to move through the website. In the end the user should trust the website. In essence a good website should have a great user
        experience and user interface design. It shouldn't be cluttered (some negative space), simple, a strong theme/brand, fluid
        resizing the grid dependent on window size, flexible visuals and fast loading times.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted mb-2">
        The accessibility of this website is focused around a continuous page (script-like) rather than having many multiple page.
        This allows for a story of our product to be told rather than giving nuggets of information on different pages. This was done
        to make the product more alluring to a potential customer, additionally the use of a youtube video allows the
        customer to get a grasp of the use of the product without neccessarily reading. With regards to blind or partially sighted people
        this device would not be best enjoyed by them (it takes images), but some functionality should be added to ensure that is adherence
        to UK Website Accessibility Laws. The website can be easily magnified and screen readers can be used to turn the text of the website into
        speech. For photos the captions are accurate enough to ensure that a visually impaired person would be able to understand what the
        image showed without seeing it. This is neccessary to abide by laws.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted mb-2">
        With regards to adherence to GDPR, data from the contact form needs to be kept in accordance to GDPR guidelines.
        Additionally, cookies are not used on the website, but if they were then there would need to be a banner to inform the user that they are being used.
        If data is collected you would have inform the user how you would intend to use the data and insure that they have been given the terms
        and conditions of the website. The website must ensure that the data is kept and it able to be retrieved if the user wanted to know
        what information was held about them. Please see below steps that need to be taken to ensure adherence to GDPR laws.
      </p>
      <a class="portfolio-box" href="img/GDPR.jpg" mb-5>

      </a>
      <p class="text-muted mb-2">
        The marketing for the website can include QR codes, facebook ads, google advertisements, instagram indorsements, radio/tv commericals,
        youtube advertisment. There are a plethora of methods to advertise and it is very dependent on the demographic which you want to pitch
        the product. For Motion Lapse it would be amateur photographers so youtube videos about photography, photography websites/magazines,
        google searches for photography equipment. Data available from big companies allows for more effective marketing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted mb-2">
        Going forward it would be prudent to include a payment method onto the website, so the customer does not neccessarily need to go
        through 3rd parties to buy the device. Hosting off of a domain which is more appropriate would make the website more credible.
        Polishing up the website more, ensuring mobile compatibility, working on the aesthetics to ensure it is professional and appealing.
        These are all steps that need to taken in the future.
